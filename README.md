# Browser Fingerprint Capture Tool

Automated tool to capture real browser fingerprints from all installed browsers on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## What It Does

- üîç **Auto-discovers** all installed browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Safari)
- üåê **Captures fingerprints** including GPU, screen, hardware, timezone, plugins, etc.
- üíæ **Saves as JSON** files for programmatic use
- üö´ **Skips duplicates** automatically
- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-platform** - works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will:
- Install Playwright
- Automatically download required browser binaries

### 2. Capture Fingerprints

```bash
npm run capture
```

Or:
```bash
node capture-real-fingerprint.js
```

### 3. What Happens

The tool will:
1. Scan your system for installed browsers
2. Launch each browser one by one (you'll see windows open)
3. Capture detailed fingerprint data
4. Save unique fingerprints to `fingerprints/` directory
5. Skip any duplicates

### 4. Collect Results

After running, send the entire `fingerprints/` folder to your team.

## Supported Browsers

- ‚úÖ **Google Chrome** (all platforms)
- ‚úÖ **Firefox** (all platforms)
- ‚úÖ **Microsoft Edge** (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- ‚úÖ **Brave Browser** (all platforms)
- ‚úÖ **Safari** (Mac only)

## Output Files

Fingerprints are saved as JSON files with names like:

```
fingerprints/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fingerprint-chrome-2025-10-22-abc123def456.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fingerprint-firefox-2025-10-22-789ghi012jkl.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fingerprint-brave-2025-10-22-mno345pqr678.json
```

Each file contains:
- Navigator properties (userAgent, platform, language, etc.)
- Screen dimensions and color depth
- WebGL vendor and renderer (GPU info)
- Canvas and audio fingerprints
- Hardware info (cores, memory)
- Timezone and locale
- Installed plugins and MIME types
- Feature detection (IndexedDB, localStorage, etc.)

## Using Captured Fingerprints

The `fingerprint-loader.js` module provides easy access to captured fingerprints:

```javascript
const { loadFingerprint } = require('./fingerprint-loader');

// Load a random fingerprint
const fp = await loadFingerprint();

// Load the first fingerprint
const fp = await loadFingerprint({ mode: 'first' });

// Load a specific fingerprint
const fp = await loadFingerprint({
  mode: 'specific',
  filename: 'fingerprint-chrome-2025-10-22-abc123.json'
});
```

## Troubleshooting

**No browsers found?**
- Make sure you have at least one supported browser installed
- The tool checks common installation paths and your system PATH

**Browser fails to launch?**
- **Firefox**: Uses Playwright's bundled version (this is normal and expected)
- **Chrome/Brave/Edge**: Should use your actual installed browsers

**"Duplicate fingerprint - skipping"?**
- Normal if you've already captured from this machine
- Only unique fingerprints are saved

**Permission errors?**
- Make sure you have permission to read browser executables
- On Linux, browsers should be in standard paths or PATH

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 14 or higher
- At least one supported browser installed
- ~300MB disk space for Playwright browser binaries

## Dependencies

- `playwright` (^1.56.1) - Browser automation library

## Files

- `capture-real-fingerprint.js` - Main capture script
- `browser-discovery.js` - Cross-platform browser detection
- `fingerprint-loader.js` - Utility for loading captured fingerprints
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
